Heisenbugs:
  sometimes evaluation of a call segmentation faults????
  this seemed to be caused by missing break statements
  in some-but-not-all switch statements causing some
  paths to process Ast nodes twice, and the second
  process generally segfaults because it assumes the
  wrong union member type. However this was not consistent
  because it depends on the exact break that was missing.
  sometimes the flow would drop into the default case
  which has always been a call of error_abort.
