Bugs:

B1: l :- x := \y : nil => y
    works as intended,
    x now has type nil -> nil
    x can be applied to the term nil
      and will evaluate to nil

    however
    l :- z := \z : nil => z
    this line typechecks and evaluates,
    however upon accessing z the program seg-faults.

B2: l :- y := \z:nil => z
      :- x := nil

    now,
      :- y x
      evaluates to nil properly

      :- y y x
      calls error_abort complaining about a malformed node.
      it should evaluate to nil
