-I flags need to tell the compiler where the include
directories are for both llvm and llvm-c. (as they are
interdependent.)

`llvm-config-10 --cxxflags --ldflags --libs`
this needs to be a part of the arguments to the
compiler, otherwise the linker complains about a
missing function internal to LLVM.
