%% Specific TODO

 TODO: 
	add support for u8/16/32/64, s8/16/32/64, f32/64

	build in support for nested block comments
	(This is a quality of life improvement for
		copy/paste'ing code)

	typecast(), sizeof()

	tokbuf grows to hold all the tokens that have been parsed,
	and never resets it's size. theoretically we should be able
	to clear the token buffer after each grapheme has been parsed.
	but each call to consume() leaves the buffer with at least
	one token in queue. i.e. after a declaration is parsed and pushed
	onto the list of declarations for the current scope, tokbuf
	will contain the first token of the next declaration or statement
	to be parsed (along with the already parsed declaration).
	this means that we will end up allocating the entire 
	parse unit (file, module) each time we call the parser. This could become
	a problem for very large parse units.
